Now that we've tested the integration with a couple of your items, it's time to create your own custom collection on OpenSea.

In order to do this, we'll use the OpenSea collection creator, which will populate all of your assets on OpenSea and give you a dedicated collection page for your items. As an example, you can check out the store for OpenSea Creatures [here](https://testnets.opensea.io/category/opensea-creature).
