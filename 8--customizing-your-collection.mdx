title: "8. Customizing your collection"
---

Now that you've created your own OpenSea collection, you can customize it to your liking! Just make sure you log in to Metamask as the owner of your smart contract (you'll need to make sure your contract is `Ownable`; if it's not, please reach out on our [Help Center](https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us)), and you'll see a button that will allow you to edit your collection. Alternatively, you can go to the [Collections Manager](https://opensea.io/collections) page to see all of your collections.

Clicking on the edit button will bring up the collection editor. Now you can customize your collection to your liking, with your own name, description, and website URL. Plus, you can [set your own fees on secondary sales](/docs/10-setting-fees-on-secondary-sales).
